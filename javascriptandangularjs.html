     <p> <b>&#10028;  client-side script :  </b> A client-side script is a small program (or set of instructions) that is embedded (or inserted) into a web page. 
      It is processed within the client browser instead of the web server.
      The client side script downloads at the client end from the server along with the HTML web page it is embedded in. 
    <br> The web browser interprets and executes the code and then displays the results on the monitor.
      The script that executes on the user’s computer system is called <b>client.</b></p>
      <br>
      <p>  <b>&#10028;  client-side scripting :  </b> Client side scripting is a process in which the code along with HTML web page is sent to the client by the server. The code executes on the browser of client’s computer either during the loading of web page or after the web page has been loaded.

        Client side scripting is mainly used for dynamic user interface elements, such as pull-down menus, navigation tools, animation buttons, data validation purpose, etc.</p>
    
      <br>
      <p> 
        <b> <b>&#10028; </b> The client-side scripting may significantly reduce server demand.  How?
        </b> <br>
        
        Its main function is to provide the requested output to the end user.
        The web needs three components to function: <b>client, database, and server</b>. <br> Client-side scripting may be utilized to check the user's form for problems before submitting it and to change the content based on the user input. <br> It can also be used to create <b>“cookies”</b> that store data on the user’s computer (such as userid and password). </p>
