<center> <h2><b> <u>Network Topology</u></b></h2> </center> <br>
           <p> &#9733; <b> Network Topology</b> A network topology is the physical and logical arrangement of nodes and connections in a network. <b>Nodes</b> usually include devices such as <b>switches, routers, device  and software</b>.</p>
           <p><b> In Other word,  Topology</b> defines the structure of the network of how all the components are interconnected to each other. </p>  
          </p>
           <br>
             
           <p><b>Types of Network Topology:</b></p>
            <p> Physical topology is the geometric representation of all the nodes in a network. There are six types of network topology which are Bus Topology, Ring Topology, Tree Topology, Star Topology, Mesh Topology, and Hybrid Topology.</p> <br>
             <br> <br>
            <h4 class="w3-center"> <b>  Bus Topology</b></h4>
            <img src="assets/img/internet/bus-topology.png" class="w3-round" alt="Writer image"  style="width: 100%;"> <br>   <br>
            <p><b>1.</b> The bus topology is designed in such a way that all the stations are connected through a single cable known as a <span style="color:darkred;"> backbone cable.</span> </p>
            <p><b>2.</b> Each <span style="color:darkred;" >node</span>  is either connected to the backbone cable by drop cable or directly connected to the backbone cable.</p>
            <p><b>3. </b> When a node wants to send a message over the network, it puts a message over the network. All the stations available in the network will receive the message whether it has been addressed or not.
             </p>

            <p><b>4.</b> The bus topology is mainly used in <span style="color:darkred;"> IEEE 802.3 (ethernet) and IEEE 802.4 (IEEE stands for Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) </span> standard networks.</p> 
            <p><b>5.</b> The configuration of a bus topology is quite simpler as compared to other topologies.</p>
            <p><b>6.</b> The backbone cable is considered as a <b>"single lane"</b> through which the message is broadcast to all the stations.</p>
            <p><b>7.</b> The most common access method of the bus topologies is <b>CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access)</b>.</p> <br>

            <p> &#9733; <b>CSMA:</b> It is a media access control used to control the data flow so that data integrity is maintained, i.e., the packets do not get lost. There are two alternative ways of handling the problems that occur when two nodes send the messages simultaneously.
            </p> 
            <p>  &#9733; <b>CSMA CD:</b> CSMA CD (Collision detection) is an access method used to detect the collision. Once the collision is detected, the sender will stop transmitting the data. Therefore, it works on <b>"recovery after the collision"</b>.
            </p>
            <p>&#9733; <b>CSMA CA:</b> CSMA CA (Collision Avoidance) is an access method used to avoid the collision by checking whether the transmission media is busy or not. If busy, then the sender waits until the media becomes idle. This technique effectively reduces the possibility of the collision. <b>It does not work on "recovery after the collision"</b>.
            </p> <br>
           
                <p><b>Advantages of Bus topology:</b></p> <br>

              <p><b>1. Low-cost cable: </b>  Here, Nodes are directly connected to the cable without passing through a hub. Therefore, the initial cost of installation is low.</p>
              <p><b>2. Moderate data speeds:</b>  Coaxial or twisted pair cables are mainly used in bus-based networks that support upto 10 Mbps.</p>
              <p><b>3. Familiar technology: </b> Bus topology is a familiar technology as the installation and troubleshooting techniques are well known, and hardware components are easily available. </p>
              <p><b>4. Limited failure:</b> A failure in one node will not have any effect on other nodes.</p> <br>
   <p><b>Disadvantages of Bus topology:</b></p> <br>

<p><b>1.</b> A bus topology is quite simpler, but still it requires a <b>lot of cabling</b>.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Bus topology is not great for <b>large networks</b>.</p>
<p><b>3.</b>If two nodes send the messages simultaneously, then the signals of both the nodes <b>collide</b> with each other.</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Adding new devices to the network would <b>slow down</b> the network.
<p><b>5.</b> <b>Need terminators</b> are required at both ends of the main cable.</p> 
<p><b>6.</b> The main disadvantage of bus topology is, if the <span style="color:darkred;">  main cable (backbone cable) is break then whole network is break down.</span> </p>

     <h4 class="w3-center"> <b>  Ring Topology:</b></h4> 

<img src="assets/img/internet/ring-topology.jpg" class="w3-round" alt="Writer image"  style="width: 100%;"> <br>   <br>


<p><b>1.</b> Ring topology is like a bus topology, but with connected <span style="color:darkred;">ends</span> (i.e., each node is connected to other node and having <span style="color: darkred;">no termination point</span>).</p>
<p><b>2.</b> The node that receives the message from the <span style="color:darkred;">previous computer will retransmit to the next node.</span></p>
<p><b>3.</b> If the data flows in one direction, i.e., it is unidirectional in the other hand, if the data flows in two direction, i.e., it is bidirectional</p>

<p><b>4.</b> The data in a ring topology flow in a clockwise direction (if it is unidirectional).</p>
<p><b>5. Token passing:</b>  It is a network access method in which token is passed from one node to another node (a token is used as a carrier).</p>
<br>
<p><b>Working of Token passing : </b> <br>
(Token: It is a frame that circulates around the network.)</p>

<p>  &#9733; Suppose computer A wants to send data to computer D then data is first placed in the packet(here the sender modifies the token by putting the address along with the data) and the packet is transferred to computer B then computer C and finally, to the computer, D. Data is travelling in the form packets in the ring topology. If the data is received in the target node then  the token received by the destination device, then it sends the acknowledgment to the sender, the empty packet is passed to the next node until it reaches the source node. The source node will finally know that its data is received successfully.</p>

<br>
<p><b>
  &#9733;  Advantages of Ring Topology</b></p>

  <p><b>1.</b> FDDI (Fiber Distributed Data Interface) is a standard for data transmission on fiber optic cables. It uses a ring topology to transmit data at high speeds. 
  </p>

  <p><b>2.</b> The possibility of collision is minimum in this type of topology.
  </p>
 <p><b>3.</b> Cheap to install.
</p>
<p>  &#9733; <b>Disadvantages of Ring Topology
</b></p>  
<p> <b>1.</b> The failure of a single node in the network can cause the entire network to fail.
</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Troubleshooting is difficult in this topology.
</p>
<p><b>3.</b> The addition of stations in between or the removal of stations can disturb the whole topology.
</p>
<p><b>4.</b> In order for all the computer to communicate with each other, all computer must be turned on.</p>
<p><b>5.</b> If one workstation shuts down, it affects whole network or if a node goes down entire network goes down.</p>

          <h4 class="w3-center"> <b> Star Topology</b></h4> 
         
          <img src="assets/img/internet/computer-network-topologies-star-topology.png" class="w3-round" alt="Writer image"  style="width: 100%;"> <br>   <br>
<p><b>1.</b> Star topology is an arrangement of the network in which every node is connected to the <span style="color:darkred;"> central hub or switch.</span> 
</p>
<p><b>2.</b> The central computer is known as a <span style="color:darkred;">  server,</span> and the peripheral devices attached to the server are known as <span style="color:darkred;">clients</span> .
</p>
<p><b>3.</b><span style="color:darkred;"> Coaxial cable or RJ-45 cables</span>  are used to connect the computers.
</p>
<p><b>4.</b><span style="color:darkred;"> Hubs or Switches</span>  are mainly used as connection devices in a physical star topology.
</p>
<p><b>5.</b> Star topology is the most popular topology in network implementation.
</p>
<p><b>6.</b> Star networks require a <span style="color:darkred;"> point-to-point connection</span>  between the central node.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Advantages of Star Topology</b></p>

<p><b>1.</b> If <b>N</b> devices are connected to each other in a star topology, then the number of cables required to connect them is <b>N</b>. So, it is easy to set up.
</p>
<p><b>2. </b>  It is high-performing due to here<span style="color:darkred;">no data collisions can occur</span> .
  </p>
<p><b>3.</b> <span style="color:darkred;">Robust  </span>  in nature.</p>
 <p><b>4.</b> Easy <span style="color:darkred;">fault detection</span>  because the link are often easily identified.
</p> 
<p><b>5.</b> <span style="color:darkred;"> No disruptions</span>  to the network when connecting or removing devices.
</p>
<br>
<p><b>Disadvantages of Star Topology</b></p>
<p><b>1.</b> If the concentrator (hub) on which the whole topology relies on <span style="color:darkred;"> if it is fails, then the whole system will crash down.
</p></span> 

<p><b>2.</b> More expensive than linear bus topology due to the value of the connecting devices (network switches).</p>
<p><b>3.</b> <span style="color:darkred;"> Hub requires more resources and regular maintenance</span>  because it’s the central system of star .</p>
<p><b>4.</b> Extra hardware is required (hubs or switches) which adds to cost.</p>

    <p><b>1. </b>  Tree topology combines the characteristics of bus topology and star topology. </p>
    <p><b>2.</b> A tree topology is a type of structure in which all the computers are connected with each other in hierarchical fashion.
    </p>
   <p><b>3. </b>  The top-most node in tree topology is known as a root node, and all other nodes are the descendants of the root node.
  </p> 
  <p> <b>4. </b>In a tree topology, there is one central node (the “trunk”), and each node is connected to the central node through a single path. </p>
 

  <br>
  <p><b>Advantages of Tree Topology :</b></p>
  <p><b>1. </b>The other nodes in a network are not affected if one of their nodes gets damaged or does not work.</p>
  <p><b>2.</b> Tree Topology is reliable.</p>
  <p><b>3. </b>It can support a large number of nodes</p>

  <br>
  <p><b>Disadvantages of Tree Topology</b></p>
  <p><b>1.</b> If any fault occurs in the node, then it becomes difficult to troubleshoot the problem.</p>
  <p> <b>2.</b> A tree topology mainly relies on main bus cable and failure in main bus cable will damage the overall network.</p>

    <p><b>1.</b> There are multiple paths from one computer to another computer.</p>
    <p><b>2.</b>  It does not contain the switch, hub or any central computer which acts as a central point of communication.</p>
    <p> <b>3.</b>The Internet is an example of the mesh topology.</p>
      <p><b>4. </b> Mesh topology is mainly used for WAN implementations and  wireless networks, where communication failures are a critical concern.</p> 
     
      <p> <b>5.</b> In this mesh topology, if one link fails, there are alternate routes that can be taken.</p>
      <br>
      <p> Mesh topology can be formed by using the formula:</p>
      <p> <b> Number of cables = (n*(n-1))/2;</b></p>
        <p> Where <b> n</b> is the number of nodes that represents the network.
        </p>  <br>
        <p><b> Advantages of Mesh Topology :</b></p>
       <p><b>1.</b> Failure during a single device won’t break the network. </p>
       <p> <b>2.</b> There is no traffic problem as there is a dedicated point to point links for every computer.</p>

       <p><b>Disadvantages of Mesh Topology :</b></p>
       <p><b>1. </b>Installation is extremely difficult in the mesh.</p>
       <p><b>2. </b>Maintenance needs are challenging with a mesh.</p>
       <p><b>3. </b>If the network is not monitored carefully, then the communication link failure goes undetected.</p>
       <p><b>4.</b> Data must go through multiple nodes to reach its destination, this can result in slower network speeds.</p> <br> <br>

 <h2 class="w3-center"><b> <u> Website Address and URL</u></b></h2>  <br>


 <h2> What is Web address ?  </h2>
 <ul class="w3-ul"> 
 <li><b>1)</b> The web address contains information about the location of the webpage. It is also known as the <span style="color:brown">  URL (uniform resource locator)</span>.
 </li>

 <li> <b>2)</b> The web address was developed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee and the URL working group of IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) in the year 1994. It is a name that points to the location of a particular web page in the internet world. </li>
<li><b>3)</b> A web address, or a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), is a unique reference that directs you to a specific page like the address of a particular file, directory, photo, video, etc. Every web page on the internet has a unique web address, with the help of which the user accesses those web pages.
</li>
 </ul>

 <br>
 
 <h2>Components of a web address </h2>
 
 
 <p>Every web address follows the same format. Let’s use this page’s URL as an example to explore the individual components: </p>
  <br>
 <p><b>Example: </b></p>
 <p>https://www.wix.com/encyclopedia/web-address/</p>
 <br>

 <ul class="w3-ul">
  <li><b> 1) Scheme:</b> It is the protocol that is associated with every URL. It tells the browser what type of address the user is trying to access so that the browser connects correctly.<br> The two most common schemes are http and https.  This page uses https, meaning it has a secure sockets layer (SSL) certificate.
 
  <p><b>Example: https:</b>//www.wix.com/encyclopedia/web-address/</p> </li>
 
  <li> <b>2) Domain name:</b>
    A domain name is the website name correlating with its internet protocol (IP) address. The domain name indicates which connecting server the internet must use to locate the webpage. It also acts as the website’s primary name. 
 
   <p><b>Example: </b>https://www.<b>wix</b>.com/encyclopedia/web-address/</p></li>
  
  
   <li><b>3) Domain extension:</b> Also referred to as a top-level domain, a domain extension is the letters that follow the domain name. The first-level set of domain names are the top-level domains (TLDs), such as com, info, net, edu, and org, and the country code(.in,.np) are top-level domains.
 
    <p><b>Example: </b>https://www.wix<b>.com</b>/encyclopedia/web-address/</p> 
   </li>

 <li> <b>4) Path: </b> Path specifies the entire path to a particular web page that the user wants to access or  webpage of the primary website the user wants to visit.
  <p><b>Example: </b>
 
    https://www.wix.com/<b>encyclopedia/web-address/</b></p> 
</li>

<li> <b>5) Subdomain: </b>A subdomain is a prefix added to a domain name to separate a section of your website.
  Site owners primarily use subdomains to manage the sections of own content 
  in hierarchy, such as online stores, blogs, job boards or support platforms.
<p><b>Example</b></p>
<p> https://<b>jobs</b>.example.com/</p>
<p> https://<b>www</b>.w3school.com/</p>

</li>

 </ul>

 <br>
<h4><b>Note:</b></h4>

<ul class="w3-ul"> 
<li>1) <b>Parameters:</b> Parameters are the query string that begins with a <b>question mark(?)</b> after the Path. This is the list of key pairs separated by an <b>ampersand(&)</b> sign.
</li>
<li>2)  <b>Anchor:</b> Anchors are like bookmarks it tell the browser which particular part of a web page the user wants to access. They are written after the Parameters and begin with a <b>hashtag(#)</b>.
</li>
<li>3) The full domain name may not exceed a total length of <b>253 ASCII</b> characters in its textual representation.
</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2>There are two types of web addresses:</h2>


<ul class="w3-ul">
<li><b>1) Absolute web address:</b> An absolute web address is the web address that contains the domain name and the entire address of the file/directory to which it points. It begins with the protocols like “http”, “https”, “ftp” etc. 
</li>

<li><b>2) Relative web address:</b> Relative web address is the web address that can be accessed only if you are on the home page or on any web page of the particular website. Since it is assumed that the user is already present on the website, a relative web address only contains the domain name and the location.
</li>

      <h2 class="w3-center"><b> <u> Introduction to IP Address</u></b></h2>  <br>
     
      <ul class="w3-ul">
        <li> <b>1) </b>   ‘IP’ stands for Internet Protocol, which is the set of rules that makes it possible for devices to communicate over the Internet. With billions of people accessing the Internet every day, unique identifiers are necessary to keep track of who is doing what. The Internet Protocol solves this by assigning IP numbers to every device accessing the Internet.
        </li>

        <li> <b>2) </b>   IP is also used for routing and addressing packets of data so that they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination. Data traversing the Internet is divided into smaller pieces, called packets. IP information is attached to each packet, and this information helps routers to send packets to the right place.
        </li>

        <li> <b> 3) </b>   An IP address is a string of numbers separated by periods. IP addresses are expressed as a set of four numbers — an example address might be 192.158.1.38. Each number in the set can range from 0 to 255. So, the full IP addressing range goes from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.
        </li>

        <li> <b>4) </b> IP addresses are not random. They are mathematically produced and allocated by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
        </li>
        <li><b>5) </b>  Each time anyone registers a domain on the internet, they go through a domain name registrar, who pays a small fee to ICANN to register the domain.
        </li>

      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2 class="w3-center"> Types of IP Address</h2>
      
      <p>1) IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4)</p>
      <p>2) IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)</p>
      <br>
      <h4><b>IPv4 : </b></h4>

      <ul class="w3-ul">
           <li> <b>1) </b> It stands for Internet Protocol version four. IPv4 was developed by DARPA which is  (ARPANET). </li>
          <li> <b>2) </b>IPv4 addresses are 32-bit integers having an address space of 2<sup>32</sup>.. 
          </li>

          <li> <b>3) </b>It is represented by 4 numbers separated by dots in the range of 0-255, which have to be converted to 0 and 1, to be understood by Computers.</li>

           <li><b>4) </b> For Example, An IPv4 Address can be written as 189.123.123.90. </li>
      </ul>
     
      <br>
      <h2 class="w3-center"> IPv4 Address Format </h2>

     <center> <h2><b> <u>There are three main types of LAN cables:</u></b></h2> </center> <br>
          <br>
          <p><b>1) Coaxial cable :</b> A coaxial cable is an electrical cable with a copper conductor and an insulator shielding around it and a braided metal mesh that prevents signal interference and cross talk. Coaxial cable is also known as coax.
          </p>
          <p> A Coaxial Cable is mostly used in cable TV. It is also in computer network.  A coaxial cable can be used over a distance of about 1 km and can achieve a transfer rate of up to 100 MBPS.( Mega Byte Per Second)
          </p>

<p><b>2) Copper twisted pair : </b></p>
<p>Twisted pair is a physical media made up of a pair of cables twisted with each other. A twisted pair cable is cheap as compared to other transmission media. Installation of the twisted pair cable is easy, and it is a lightweight cable. The frequency range for twisted pair cable is from 0 to 3.5KHz.
</p>
<p>A twisted pair consists of two insulated copper wires arranged in a regular spiral pattern. The degree of reduction in noise interference is determined by the number of turns per foot. Increasing the number of turns per foot decreases noise interference.

<p><b>1) Unshielded Twiested Pair Cable:</b></p>
<p>UTP is an unshielded twisted pair cable used in computer and telecommunications mediums.  It is a pair of insulated copper wires twisted together to reduce noise generated by external interference. It is a wire with no additional shielding, like aluminium foil, to protect its data from the exterior.
</p>
 
<img src="assets/img/internet/unshieldedtwistedpaircable.png" class="w3-round" alt="Writer image"  style="width: 100%;"> <br>   <br>
<p><b>2) STP (Shielded twisted pair):</b></p>
    <p> A shielded twisted pair is a type of twisted pair cable that contains an extra wrapping foil or copper braid jacket to protect the cable from defects like cuts, losing bandwidth, noise, and signal to the interference. It is a cable that is usually used underground, and therefore it is costly than UTP. It supports the higher data transmission rates across the long distance.</p>

<p><b>3) Fiber Optic Cable:</b></p>
<p> A fiber optic cable can contain a varying number of these glass fibers -- from a few up to a couple hundred. Another glass layer, called cladding, surrounds the glass fiber core. The buffer tube layer protects the cladding, and a jacket layer acts as the final protective layer for the individual strand.

     <p><b>BroadBand : </b></p>
     <p>Broadband is a wide bandwidth transmission that can transmit multiple signals and data over a very high-speed internet connection. According to the Federal Communications Commission, a broadband connection has a minimum of 25 Mbps download speed and 3 Mbps of upload speed. There are 4 types of broadband connections, namely- DSL (Digital Subscriber Line), Cable, Fibre Optics and Satellite.

    <p><b>What is USB Tethering?</b></p>
    <p>When the mobile internet connection is shared with a connected computer or laptop using physical USB data cable then it is called USB Tethering. It gives a high-speed connection while sharing the internet between mobile devices and connected computer systems, it is because Wired connection is quite stronger than Wireless LAN connection.
    </p>
    <br>
       
 <p><b>What is MAC Address?
</b></p>
<p>MAC address is the physical address, which uniquely identifies each device on a given network. To make communication between two networked devices, we need two addresses: IP address and MAC address. It is assigned to the NIC (Network Interface card) of each device that can be connected to the internet.
  It stands for Media Access Control, and also known as Physical address, hardware address, or BIA (Burned In Address).
  It is globally unique; it means two devices cannot have the same MAC address. It is represented in a hexadecimal format on each device, such as 00:0a:95:9d:67:16.
  </p>
  <br>

<p><b>IMEI :</b></p>
<p> IMEI  stands for “International Mobile Equipment Identity.” It’s a unique number for identifying a device on a mobile network. You can think of it as your phone’s social security number. It has 15 digits and is assigned to every GSM phone.( Global System for Mobile Communication)
</p>
<p>This number comes in handy when your handset gets lost or stolen. No, it won’t magically bring the phone back to you, but you can make sure whoever found or stole it won’t be able to use it. Your carrier can deny listing a device based on its IMEI number and request other carriers to do the same. This means the phone won’t make/receive calls anymore or connect online via the cellular network, even with a new SIM card.
