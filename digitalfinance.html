<center> <h2><b> <u>Card [Credit / Debit] </u></b></h2> </center>
<br>
<p><b>What is a Debit Card?</b></p>
<p>A Debit card is issued by a bank against your current account or savings account. The major point to be noted about a debit card is that it allows you to use only the amount of money that’s available in your bank account at the moment. This implies that as you make payment using your debit card, the amount of purchase will directly be debited from your current or savings account.
</p>
<br>
<p><b>What is a Credit Card?</b></p>
<p>A Credit card is a financial tool that allows you to borrow funds from your credit card issuer at the luxury of making purchases as and when required. Additionally, to repay the borrowed amount, you get a grace period of around 45 days without any interest charges on the billed amount. When you buy a credit card, you get a customized credit limit, which indicates the maximum amount that you can spend using your credit card.
</p>
<br>
<p><b>Similarities in a Debit Card and Credit Card :-</b></p>
<p>1) Both of these cards look identical and have a 16-digit card number.</p>
<p>2)A debit card and a credit card have expiration date.</p>
<p>3) In order to make a transaction, using either of these cards, you must enter a PIN (Personal Identification Number) code.</p>
<p>4)Both, debit card and credit card can be used to make online and offline purchases.</p>
<p>5)Both these cards can be used at an ATM in order to withdraw money. </p>

           <p>After receiving payment, the merchant may issue a receipt for the transaction, which is usually printed but can also be dispensed with or sent electronically.</p>
