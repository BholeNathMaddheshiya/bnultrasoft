                    <li>  <b>  1). Connectivity :-  </b> Connectivity is an essential feature of IoT. IoT can connect through several wireless devices, like sensors, mobile phones, trackers, etc. This way, the person will not have to wait for an internet connection to operate a device.  </li>
               
                    <li> <b> 2). Identity of Things :-  </b> Identity helps to differentiate between various internet devices. It is essential to give a unique identity to every device so that we can select the device and send the command to it.</li>
                   <li> <b>3). Intelligence :- </b> The intelligence of IoT devices depends on the sensors' intelligence. As we know the sensors are automatically detects the changing environment send the data to the user for further analysis. </li>
                  <li> <b> 4). Dynamic and Self-Adapting :- </b> IoT devices are dynamic, Assume a CCTV camera meant for surveillance. It should be work in different conditions and different light situations (morning, afternoon, and night).</li>
                  <li> <b> 5). Scalability :- </b> The number of elements connected to the IoT zone is increasing day by day. Hence, an IoT setup can capable of handling the massive expansion. it can handled appropriately and accurately.</li>
                  <li> <b>6). Self Upgradation :- </b> It also allows the set up of a network for the addition of any new IoT devices. Thus, the technology can quickly start working without delay if the setup has already been done.</li>
                  <li> <b> 7). Architecture :- </b> The architecture of IoT is designed in a way that it is capable of supporting various devices, technologies, and protocols. Its main work is to confirm whether each connected device does not interfere with the other. </li>
                   <li> <b> 8). Security :- </b> With the increasing number of IoT devices, issues regarding the security of personal data have arisen. There might be a chance of data leakage, Maintaining safety and security is a big dare for IoT. However, it still handles it without any disruption.</li>
                   <li> <b>9). Network :- </b> With the increasing number of IoT devices in a network, it becomes difficult to maintain communication for proper functioning. However, cloud service and gateway are a few methods that can solve such problems. Because IoT devices can communicate with one another, it is more effective and adaptable than other current technologies.</li>
                  <li> <b>10). Data :- </b> The data gathered from IoT devices are analyzed for future prediction. Example weather condition information which is collected by sensor (Temperature and humidity sensors).</li>

                 <p><b> &#10028; </b>  There are typically 4 main components of IoT :-  </p>
                  <ul class="w3-ul"> 
                    <li>&#10028; <span style="color: rgb(115, 2, 7);"> <b>Sensors and actuators</b></span>  </li>

                  </ul>
                    
                 <br>
                 <p><b> &#10028; Sensors and actuators :- </b> <br> These are the devices that collect data from the environment and carry out actions based on that data. They are sometimes referred to as “things” in IoT. <br>

                    Sensors are used to collect data, such as temperature, light, sound, or pressure. Actuators, on the other hand, are used to carry out an action based on the data that has been collected, such as turning on a light or opening a door.</p> 
                

                <p><b> &#10028; Connectivity :-  </b> Connectivity element plays a very significant task in IoT. After the data is collected, it needs a way to get to the cloud (or other data storage location) so it can be processed and analyzed. This is where connectivity comes in. <br>

                    Connectivity refers to the various technologies that are used to connect devices to the internet, such as WiFi, Bluetooth, cellular, or satellite. The data that was gathered through the sensors is then transmitted over the internet using one of these technologies. </p>    
                

               <p> <b> &#10028; Data processing :- </b> After data successfully uploads to the cloud, computing software, and big-data analytics process it needs to be processed and analyzed through data processing for the end-user. For example:- night vision and motion sensors can detect unauthorised activity within a defined parameter. Still, the signals get sent to the user via an alert or video footage.</p> 

               <p> <b>  &#10028;  User interface :- </b> Last but not least, we have the user interface. The user interface is what allows humans to interact with IoT devices and systems. This is the last stage of the data processing. After getting notifications through email or text message, it helping us make a decision, the user may also be able to perform an action and affect the system, it also automatically notify security teams to take action on it.</p>

                  <p><b> &#10028;  Perception Layer : </b>  This is the first layer of IoT architecture. In the perception layer, number of sensors and actuators are used to gather useful information like temperature, moisture content, intruder detection, sounds, etc. The main function of this layer is to get information from surroundings and to pass data to another layer so that some actions can be done based on that information.
                 </p>
                 <p><b> &#10028; Network Layer :</b>    As the name suggests, it is the connecting layer between perception and middleware layer. It gets data from perception layer and passes data to middleware layer using networking technologies like 3G, 4G, UTMS, WiFI, infrared, etc. This is also called communication layer because it is responsible for communication between perception and middleware layer. All the transfer of data done securely keeping the obtained data confidential.
                 </p>
                 <p> <b>&#10028;   Middleware Layer : </b> Middleware Layer has some advanced features like storage, computation, processing, action taking capabilities. It stores all data-set and based on the device address and name it gives appropriate data to that device. It can also take decisions based on calculations done on data-set obtained from sensors.
                 </p>
                 <p> <b>&#10028; Application Layer :  </b>The application layer manages all application process based on information obtained from middleware layer. This application involves sending emails, activating alarm, security system, turn on or off a device, smartwatch, smart agriculture, etc.
                 </p>
                 <p> <b>&#10028;  Business Layer : </b>   The success of any device does not depend only on technologies used in it but also how it is being delivered to its consumers. Business layer does these tasks for the device. It involves making flowcharts, graphs, analysis of results, and how device can be improved, etc.
