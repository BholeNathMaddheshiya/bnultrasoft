                                <p><b> &#10028; Sensors: </b> Sensors are a kind of electronic components that detect the presence or absence of something. Depending upon the sensitivity of a sensor, it can also detect changes that happen with respect to time.</p> 
                           
                                <p> <b> &#10028; Transducer : </b>A transducer is a device that converts one form of energy into another, such as converting mechanical energy into electrical signals. On the other hand, a sensor is a device that detects and responds to a specific input, such as light, temperature, pressure, or motion and converts it into a measurable output.</p>
                                <p>Thus, we can understand that a Sensor is not a perfect sensor unless it is coupled with a transducer. Sensor detects whatever it has to detect and transducers then convert that recognized energy into a human readable and understandable data that we get as output.</p>

                                     <p> IR sensor is a device that uses infrared technology to detect objects or changes in the environment. IR sensors can detect a wide range of physical properties such as temperature, motion, and proximity(Nearest). Proximity Sensors convert information on the movement or presence of an object into an electrical signal.</p>

                                     <p>An ultrasonic sensor is an electronic device that measures the distance of a target object by emitting ultrasonic sound waves, and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal. Ultrasonic waves travel faster than the speed of audible sound (i.e. the sound that humans can hear). <br> Ultrasonic sensors have two main components: the transmitter (which emits the sound using piezoelectric crystals) and the receiver (which encounters the sound after it has travelled to and from the target).</p>

                                            <p>  In Von Neumann’s architecture microcontrollers, there is a single memory space that stores both program instructions and data. This memory is often referred to as RAM (Random Access Memory).
                                            </p>
                                            <p> These microcontrollers typically have a single bus that connects the CPU to the memory, which is used for both fetching program instructions and accessing data.
                                            </p>
                                <p>Program code (instructions) and data are stored together in the same memory space. This means that the CPU can access program instructions and data sequentially from the same memory.
                                </p>           
 <p>In Von Neumann architecture, when the CPU needs to fetch an instruction, it may have to wait if there is a data access operation in progress, potentially leading to slower execution of instructions compared to Harvard architecture. That's the reason microcontrollers that use Von Neumann architecture are less common compared to Harvard architecture-based microcontrollers.
