             <p><b>Presentation Software : </b>
                Presentation Software allows you to display information in the form of an electronic slide show. It  is specifically designed to allow users to create a presentation of ideas. It helps in explaning the topic in text, images and audio/video. Example : Microsoft PowerPoint, LibreOffice Impress, Google Slide etc.
                
                Every presentation consists of a number of slides that describe a topic with text or graphics. Here a slide is a single page of a presentation.

It has five tabs: Normal, Outline, Notes, Handout, and Slide Sorter. These five tabs are called View buttons.
            </p> <br>
